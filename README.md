# Note Taker

## About this App

### Description

Note Taker is an app that a user can use to create, save, view, and delete notes.

### User Story

As a user looking for a way to keep track of notes, I would like an application that allows me to write things down, store them for later to edit them if I would like, or delete them if needed. When I am on the homepage, I am presented with a clean slate and a button to add a note. Once I have added a note, I can either edit that note, delete it, or create a new one.

### Features

1. Notes are stored to local storage.
2. Note Taker is built with Bootstrap and is fully mobile responsive.
3. Because this application runs on an Express.js server, it has been deployed using Heroku.
